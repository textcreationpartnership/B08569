            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN obedience to your Commands, I here ſend you a ſhort Account of Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi>'s Book, now in the Preſs at <hi>Oxford;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Title of it is, <hi>Linguarum veterum Septentrionalium Theſaurus Grammatico-criticus &amp; Archaeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicus. Accedit de Linguarum veterum Septentrionalium uſu Diſſertatio: Et Catalogus librorum veterum Septentrionalium, tam eorum qui excuſi ſunt, quam qui in membranis ſcripti nondum eduntur, quam fieri licuit, locupletiſſimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Book is Printed in a large <hi>Folio,</hi> upon very good Paper, and according to its Title, it conſiſts of three Parts, 1. the Grammaticals, which contain iv Grammars: One for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue, as it was ſpoken in <hi>Moeſia,</hi> above MCCC Years ago. Another of the <hi>Engliſh-Saxon,</hi> which deſcended from that ancient <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue. A third, of the ancient <hi>German,</hi> or <hi>Teutonick</hi> Tongue, as it was ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> DCCCC Years ago, and for which the Emperor <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> the greateſt Scholar, as well as Soldier of his time, did not think it below his Imperial Majeſty, to make a Grammar with his own Hand. The fourth, is a Grammar of the old <hi>Scandian, Cimbrick,</hi> or <hi>Iſlandick</hi> Language, ſpoken by our old Maſters the <hi>Danes,</hi> who changed the <hi>Engliſh-Saxon</hi> into a Dialect, which the Author calls, the <hi>Dano-Saxonick,</hi> or <hi>Daniſh-Saxon</hi> Tongue. The two firſt Grammars are framed into one, becauſe of the near alliance of thoſe two Languages, which much illuſtrate each other. And this Grammar is in effect, an Account of the Original, and Progreſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, from the ancient <hi>Gothick,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh-Saxon,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Dano-Saxonick,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Norman-Saxon,</hi> or <hi>Anglo-Normanick</hi> Tongue: Of all theſe Dialects, the Author gives a clear Account, as alſo of the <hi>Engliſh-Saxon</hi> Poetry, and of its degenerating into <hi>Rime,</hi> occaſion'd by the corruption of the more pure <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-Saxon</hi> Tongue. In this Grammar alſo are very many <hi>Saxon</hi> Originals tranſlated into <hi>Latin,</hi> which were never before Printed, with many chargeable Sculptures, of which ſome may be ſeen in a Copy of the Book, at Mr. <hi>Kebles</hi> the Bookſeller, at the <hi>Turks-head</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet.</hi> In the other two Grammars are many Curioſities, too numerous to be deſcribed here, and in the laſt of them many Leaves of coſtly Sculpture, whereof ſome are to be ſeen in the foreſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Book. Theſe Grammars are full of Obſervations, and Marginal Notes, which not only illuſtrate the Antiquities of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſters, but ſhew the true Cauſes, and Originals of our own, and all the Languages of the North parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as of a great part of the <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongues.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Part, concerning the uſe of the old <hi>Septentrional</hi> Languages, are many Diſcourſes of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Antiquities, in which are many <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of their Courts of <hi>Judicature, Wills</hi> and <hi>Teſtaments;</hi> Contracts of <hi>Bargain</hi> and <hi>Sale;</hi> Forms of <hi>Manumiſſion</hi> of their Villanes, or <hi>Predial Slaves; Original Charters,</hi> never before Printed, the greateſt part of which are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Latin,</hi> with ſome Sculptures, and particular Diſquiſitions; as of the Original of the Court of <hi>Chancery;</hi> of the manner of making <hi>Wills,</hi> and the <hi>Probat</hi> of them among the <hi>Saxons;</hi> of their <hi>Donations,</hi> and <hi>Conveyances;</hi> and a Diſcourſe of the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Norman Charters,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between them, and how true are to be diſtinguiſhed from falſe Charters; with Platforms of Diſcourſes upon many other curious, and uſeful Subjects, not yet written upon; of which the Author ſhews none can write well, but thoſe, who are very well skill'd in the <hi>old Septentrional Languages.</hi> In this Part there will alſo be a <hi>Series</hi> of all the <hi>Saxon-Coyns</hi> in Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with Explications; with a curious <hi>Saxon-Homilie,</hi> Preached by a Biſhop on a Day of publick Faſting, and Penitence; and an Account of the <hi>burial Places</hi> of the moſt famous <hi>Saxon</hi> Saints, tranſlated into <hi>Latin,</hi> never before Printed; and a fragment of Hiſtory in the ancient <hi>Scandian</hi> Language, written in <hi>Runick</hi> Characters, but Printed in <hi>Runick</hi> and common Letters, with a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>The Catalogue of the old <hi>Septentrional</hi> MSS. which makes the third Part, is an Hiſtorical, and Comparative Catologue, in which is Printed the beginning, and ending of every <hi>MS.</hi> that the curious Reader may know whether <hi>MSS.</hi> which have the ſame Title, are the ſame, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Books. Imperfect <hi>MSS.</hi> are alſo noted, as thoſe likewiſe, whoſe Leaves are miſplaced by the Binder; and if imperfect <hi>MSS.</hi> of one Place, or Library may be ſupplied by more perfect Copies in another, that alſo is noted. Several Sheets of this Catalogue are already Printed in the above-mention'd Copy at Mr <hi>Kebles,</hi> to which I refer you, and your Friends, who are Lovers of Antiquity. As to your two Queſtions, How much of this Work is Printed? and, Of how many Sheets it will conſiſt? I anſwer to the firſt, That there are almoſt CXL Sheets Printed off; and the Author thinks it will be a Book of CC, or CCXX Sheets.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:184390:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Bookſellers, whom the dearneſs of Paper obligeth to Print no Books, but of quick and common Sale at home, having refuſed to undertake the Impreſſion of this great Work; the Author hath adventur'd to undertake it himſelf, upon the encouragement of many Learned Gentlemen, eſpecially among the Learned Clergy, who, in many parts of the Kingdom, have generouſly contributed towards the Printing thereof. It is hoped, that Learned Gentlemen, and Patrons of Learning of other Ranks and Profeſſions, will likewiſe contribute to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it; which, as you may perceive by the ſhort, and I aſſure you but imperfect Account I have briefly given of it, as well as by the Titles of its <hi>Indexes,</hi> which follow, will be of great uſe to the Republick of Learning; and for the Credit and Honour of our County, to have a Book Printed in it, which lays open ſo many ancient Languages, and illuſtrates the Laws and Cuſtoms of thoſe Countries where they were ſpoken, and moſt eſpecially thoſe of our own, and which muſt bring the Students of the <hi>Septentrional</hi> Literature in all Nations, to a more eaſie and advantgeous correſpondence in their Studies.</p>
